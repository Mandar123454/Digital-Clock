How It Works
HTML
The HTML file contains the structure of the page, including the clock container and a footer. It also links to the CSS for styling and the JavaScript for functionality.

CSS
The background animation is created using radial gradients and keyframe animations to move waves in the background.

The clock styling uses vibrant colors, shadow effects, and a pulse animation for an interactive feel.

The footer is styled with a glowing text animation.

JavaScript
The JavaScript file gets the current time and date, formats them, and updates the content of the clock and date elements every second.

Customization
Feel free to modify the following to suit your preferences:

Colors: Adjust the colors of the clock, date, and background by modifying the #clock, #date, and body sections in style.css.

Fonts: Change the font family and font size in style.css to fit your design.

Animation: Adjust the keyframe animations like pulse and shine for different visual effects.
